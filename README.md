# QR-Codes
Recently got fascinated with how QR codes work, gonna try to code my own QR generator from scratch


UPDATE FOR SELF REFERENCE:

It's interesting, but there is a very specific way in which the qr code readers are coded, so unless I look into that, pure logic won't be able to help

The required Reed solomon encoding depends on the way the encoders work. 


Pausing this project for now
